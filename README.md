# ATFyre
This website uses mathematical algorithms to simulate a firefighting device, called ATFyre. ATFyre ensures that first responders are able to arrive at the scene immediately, through the usage of heat-detecting nodes, which communicate to a control centre in its region with radio waves. The control centre then uses satellite connectivity to contact emergency services, saving paramount amounts of time, as budding fires grow quickly. Accessible, effective, and innovative, this product is truly one of the defining pieces of technology in humanity's ongoing fight against climate change.
